### What is automation testing

### What are advantages/benifits of automation testing
- Faster execution 
- Shift left by running regressing every day or with every build
- reduces chances of human error


### What are different components/modules are Selenium product 
### What is difference between  Selenium RC vs Web Driver vs IDE vs Grid (or any combination)
1. Selenium RC (No longer Supported)- 
    - It worked by infusing JavaScript into a website page to control the program's way of behaving
    - It needed RC server to be begun before running tests
    - it was slow and was not compatible with all the browsers
2. Selenium Web Driver (Available to use)- 
    - This is a fresher and further developed instrument for program robotization. 
    - It tends to large numbers of the impediments of Selenium RC and has turned into the standard decision for web testing computerization.
    - cross browser compatiblity using drivers.
3. Selenium IDE (No longer Supported)- 
    - Selenium IDE is primarily a record and playback tool for creating simple automated test scripts. It's a browser extension available for Chrome and Firefox.
    - Selenium IDE is easy to use and is often used by beginners for creating quick test scripts without writing much code.
    - Selenium IDE supports only its own Selenium scripting language, making it less flexible for complex automation tasks.
    - It is limited to browsers with browser extensions (typically Chrome and Firefox).
    - It is for testers who may not have strong programming skills.
    - It is suitable for simple test scenarios and may not be suitable for complex automation tasks.
4. Selenium Grid - 
    - It is a smart proxy server that enables parallel test execution across multiple machines and browser environments. 
    - It works by routing WebDriver commands (in JSON format) from a central hub to one or more remote nodes, each running different browsers or operating systems.
